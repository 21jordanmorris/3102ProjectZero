# PrimeGenerator
Project 0 - Prime Generator

Learning Objectives
 Setting up your Programming Environment and Tools
  
 Review of the Use of Control Structures
  
 Empirical Analysis of Two Prime Sequence Generation Algorithms
  
 Familiarization with the Course Programming Conventions
  
The purpose of the first programming exercise is to familiarize you with the
programming standards and coding conventions that are required for this
course. All students taking this course are expected to have a certain level of
proficiency which includes the ability to read and understand code written by
others. Students are also expected to write code that efficiently implements
and tests various algorithms using programming constructs studied in your
programming classes and methods whose syntaxes and usage information you
can find in the online Java API documentation.
